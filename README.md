## Essential Questions

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
I start by talking with users—whether through interviews, surveys, or observing their workflow—to uncover their real goals and pain points. I then translate those insights into user stories with clear acceptance criteria (“As a ___, I want ___ so that ___”). Writing stories in the user’s language keeps the team focused on delivering tangible value rather than abstract features, and ensures each increment addresses a real need.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I favor an iterative, test-driven approach: break work into small, vertical slices, write automated tests first, then implement until the tests pass. From our Scrum course, I’ll carry forward daily stand-ups to synchronize the team, backlog refinement sessions to keep our priorities sharp, and sprint retrospectives to continuously improve both our code and our collaboration habits.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a strong teammate means communicating proactively, owning my commitments, and offering help when others are blocked. It’s about listening as much as speaking, respecting diverse viewpoints, and giving honest, constructive feedback. Above all, I strive to align around shared goals—celebrating successes together and tackling challenges as one team.
